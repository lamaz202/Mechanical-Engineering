task 1 
I successfully gathered and integrated various robot components, resulting in a significantly enhanced mechanical framework. Through my diligent efforts, I was able to optimize the robot's design and functionality, ensuring that it is now better equipped to perform its intended tasks with increased efficiency and effectiveness. My improvements to the robot's structure have enabled it to operate with greater precision and reliability, and I am confident that it will continue to serve its purpose well into the future.

task 2 
The task involves utilizing a pivot joint within the robot's body, specifically located at the neck joint, to facilitate rotational motion along a single axis. This motion enables the robot's head to perform vertical tilting (up and down) as well as horizontal rotation (left and right). To achieve this movement, two electric DC motors are employedâ€”one for controlling the X direction and the other for the Y direction. These motors work in tandem, coordinating their actions to guide the robot's head towards specific angles between the two axes.
